# Sample-pbix-files

In this repository are sample pbix files that can be used for testing. These are copies of Power BI samples from [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/sample-datasets#download-original-sample-power-bi-files).

These samples are updated to use [enhanced metadata format](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-enhanced-dataset-metadata).
